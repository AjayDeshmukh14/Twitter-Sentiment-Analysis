They should have remade the Lion King in pixel art.
The Lion King remake looks beyond boring and uncharismatic. They did my boy Scar so dirty... literally. There's just no charm besides maybe impressive animation. I'm not usually an "original purist" but yeah, I'm gonna pass on this one, chief.

This is why I think the new Lion King trailer looks bad. It's one thing for live action remakes featuring humans, but is a movie featuring all animal characters.
